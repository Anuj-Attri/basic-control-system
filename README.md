# Experiments to Gain a deeper Understanding of Control Systems

A collection of basic Control Systems simulations using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Experiments:
* Transfer Function Response Optimization
> Given a linear/non-linear transfer fucntion, can we optimize the coefficients for faster steady state response?

## About Simulink 

Simulink is a highly sophisticated software used to simulate multiple scenarios for real time applications. Check more about Simulink and MATLAB [here](https://www.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo)
