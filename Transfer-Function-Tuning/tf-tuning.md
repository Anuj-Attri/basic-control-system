# Transfer Function Coefficient Tuning for Faster Response

**Given,** 
* Transfer function F(s) = $$K/(Ts + 1)$$ , where T is  the **Time constant**.

Our goal is to optimize the coefficients K & T such that the response of the input signal and the output signal at steady state can be reached in minimum time.

## Cases:
We optimize and manually enter the values of K and T, and thus plot the scope after each run.

### Case 1: K=10, T=5

For the above values of coefficients, we obtain the following scope:
